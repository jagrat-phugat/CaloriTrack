# CaloriTrack

## Overview
This project demonstrates how to predict calories burnt using machine learning techniques. The model is trained on a dataset containing physiological parameters and activity details to provide accurate calorie expenditure estimates.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering.
- Multiple machine learning models for prediction.
- Model evaluation and performance analysis.
- Visualization of key insights.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Scikit-learn
- XGBoost
- Pandas & NumPy
- Matplotlib & Seaborn

## Cloning
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/CaloriTrack.git
   cd CaloriTrack
   ```

## Usage
1. Open Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
2. Run the `Calories_Burnt_Prediction.ipynb` notebook.
3. Input user details and activity parameters to get calorie predictions.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of the following features:
- Age, Gender, Weight, and Height
- Activity Type (e.g., Walking, Running, Cycling)
- Duration and Heart Rate
- Calories Burnt (Target Variable)

## Model Training
The following machine learning models were used:
- Linear Regression
- Ridge & Lasso Regression
- Support Vector Machine (SVC)
- Random Forest Regressor
- XGBoost Regressor

## Results
- Achieved high accuracy in calorie burn prediction.
- Model evaluation includes metrics like RMSE and RÂ² score.

## Future Improvements
- Enhance model accuracy with deep learning techniques.
- Integrate real-time sensor data (e.g., from smartwatches).
- Deploy as a web or mobile application.
